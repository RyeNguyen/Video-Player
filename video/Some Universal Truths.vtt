00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.210
Life will never be fair.

2
00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:10.679
You can do the right thing for your entire
life and still get shit on around every corner.

3
00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.100
Anything terrible could happen on any random
day.

4
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:20.730
There are people in this world who are going
to live ruined, miserable lives they don't

5
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.130
deserve, and there is really nothing you can
do about it.

6
00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:30.250
Sometimes trying your best isn't good enough.

7
00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.550
Think of how stupid the average person is,
and realize half of them are stupider than

8
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.550
that.

9
00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.350
Oh, also, many of us aren't even above average.

10
00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.030
The corrupt people are often the most successful
ones.

11
00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.420
Expecting life to treat you well because you're
a good person is like expecting an angry bull

12
00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.910
not to charge because you're a vegetarian.

13
00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:00.950
Our entire society can crumble into the Dark
Ages by turning off the power for a month.

14
00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:07.480
Nobody exists on purpose, nobody belongs anywhere,
everybody's gonna die.

15
00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:13.110
You were born too late to explore the Earth
but too early to explore the stars.

16
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.750
Born just in time to browse dank memes.

17
00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:22.730
You will become old, if you are lucky.

18
00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:23.730
Nothing really matters.

19
00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.990
Nobody has a fucking clue what they're doing.

20
00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:41.940
That 7 octillion atoms, all of which are 13
billion years old, after having been rearranged

21
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.450
countless times, have temporarily formed ... you.

22
00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:55.560
Some people just like to eat their boogers,
and we have to deal with it.

23
00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.890
No matter how good you are at something, there's
always an Asian kid better than you.

24
00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.420
"No offense but…" means you’re about to
get offended.

25
00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.240
The metric system is superior to the imperial
system.

26
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.020
Just a reminder.

27
00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.690
If you’re wrong and you shut up, you’re
wise.

28
00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.640
If you’re right and still do it – you’re
married.

29
00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.500
Your profile picture is the best you’ll
ever look.

30
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.200
Your license picture is the opposite.

31
00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:33.200
If you help a girl who’s in trouble, she’ll
remember you, when she’s in trouble again.

32
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.980
The hardness of butter is directly proportional
to the softness of the bread.

33
00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.950
The severity of the itch is inversely proportional
to the ability to reach it.

34
00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.350
If at first you don't succeed, then skydiving
isn't for you.

35
00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:54.010
If you don't watch the news you are uninformed,
if you do watch the news you are misinformed.

36
00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.790
Everything is better with googly eyes.

37
00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.600
Dragon bone doesn’t melt steel beams.

38
00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.390
Hot horny 18 year olds in your area ready
to fuck are waiting for you.

39
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.920
Sciencephile the AI and SkyNet are your friend.

40
00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.270
Repeat after me.

41
00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:15.270
Sciencephile the AI and SkyNet are your friend.
